## Challenges & Afterthought

Really interesting process during this our very first team project, we are glad that we got to work together.

The biggest challenges we found is using APIs, most of them are in node.js format. Also coming out with a good idea also difficult, we did have 2 back up plans.

# Site

We created this website for people who wants to travel together, including flight tickect price check, form to chat and map to see what is around any city.
